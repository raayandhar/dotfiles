# settings
emacs.el and other useful files for myself (and others)

# todo
- new to fully customize color theme, some of it is still messy
  - ~also the color theme when you're navigating files and stuff looks
    so ugly~ mostly done, need to fix a few parts of Helm
- rest of Prof.Fleurets stuff as you see fit
- add the nice new useful functions and keybinds to emacs notes
- latex-mode
  - default latex templates (make multiple for different use cases,
    homework, notes, etc)
- org-mode for note-taking, make it easy
- cuda-mode :O
- ml-mode(s)
- test all the functionality properly
- his other files (selector.el!!)
- include other useful custom scripts and other little tidbits
  - kitty.conf, etc
    - needs further customization, but good start
- organization of repository
- images for reference (themes)

# note:
- most of this comes from [Prof. Francois Fleuret](https://fleuret.org/cgi-bin/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=elisp.git;a=tree)
  - but I changed the themes, add some of my own stuff, and made it a
    little more mac-friendly. the large bulk of it is Prof. Fleuret's
    work, though
