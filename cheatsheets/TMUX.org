* Basics
~tmux~ is a terminal multiplexer. The config is located in ~~/.tmux.conf~ and you use a soft link to install the config, i.e. ~ln -sf ~/Github/dotfiles/.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf~.
There are a few basic ideas:
- A *session* is a collection of windows
- A *window* is a full screen view ("tab")
- A *pane* is a section of a window
The default prefix for all commands is ~C-b~. The config here enable mouse support to scroll and select text.
